- **Responsive Design:** Ensures a seamless experience across all devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js, React Router, Bootstrap
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens), Bcrypt (for password hash)
- **Image Upload:** Cloudinary for storing and managing uploaded images
- **Deployment:** Vercel (frontend), Render(backend), MongoDB Atlas (database)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine with latest version or v22.2.0 above
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB server)
- Cloudinary account for image storage

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/campus-connect.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages:

   ```sh
   cd campus-connect
   cd backend
   npm install
   cd..
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. ## If you don't want to change the`.env` credentials skip step 4 and move to step 5.

4. Set up environment variables:

   - Create a `config.env` file after creating a `config folder` in the backend directory, containing the following variables:

   ```env
   PORT=
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
   FRONTEND_URL=
   DB_URL=
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=
   JWT_EXPIRE=
   COOKIE_EXPIRE=
   ```

   Replace each value with your specific configuration details.

5. Run the application backend (make sure you are in `/backend` directory) :

   ```sh
   node server.js
   ```

6. Run the application frontend (make sure you are in `/frontend` directory) :
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
7. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to view the app.
